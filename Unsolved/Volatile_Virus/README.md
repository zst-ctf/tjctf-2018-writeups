## Challenge 

Written by Alaska47

My computer seems to be running quite slow these days. I probably downloaded a virus or something. Luckily I was able grab some [stuff](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SRj7BpbAkW7aHquasTBOzD_Fuil_wAbF) off it before it crashed.

Edit: Please submit the md5 hash of the entire, lowercased flag (including tjctf{}) instead of actually submitting the flag.

## Hint
Superponible is my favorite blogger. Somedays I just sit in front of my computer, read up on popular blog posts, and order my downloads like a Matryoshka doll.
